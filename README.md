# Combiner-GANS
Using GANS architecture to solve how broken object did look like before break. "Use cases Archaeology".

# Pix2Pix:
Model_2 in models builder folder represents pix2pix architecture which gave a good results as explained below

# Data:
Gathered data of around 600 images belonging to 9 objects "Carton objects are easy to find and ripe".

# Results So Far:

 # Predicted Image "Pix2pix"("300 epochs", "Data_version: 3-10-22"):

The model didn't see the first two images on the left, but saw the last image during training.

It needs more training and more data, but unfortunately I've limited resources to continue training with more images.

I also tried AutoEnconders but didn't get good results
