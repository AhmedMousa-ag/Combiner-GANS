# Combiner-GANS
Using GANS architecture to solve how broken object did look like before break. "Use cases Archaeology".

# This project is still in progress.... 

# Pix2Pix:
Model_2 in models builder represents pix2pix architecture and it doesn't look promsing, so will try with Diffusion models

# Data:
So far gathered data of 600 images to 9 objects.

# Results So Far:


 Test Image:

 Predicted Image "Pix2pix"("51 epochs", "Data_version: 3-10-22", "Re experimenting"):

So will continue gathering data and move with GANs arch.
